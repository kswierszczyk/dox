These are likely to be carpenter bees, named for their habit of excavating holes in wood, in order to rear their young. Carpenter bees prefer unpainted, weathered wood, especially softer varieties such as redwood, cedar, cypress and pine. Painted or pressure-treated wood is much less susceptible to attack. Common carpenter bee nesting sites include eaves, rafters, fascia boards, siding, wooden shake roofs, decks and outdoor furniture.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home-and-gardening/carpenter-bees/traps":{"id":"home-and-gardening/carpenter-bees/traps","title":"Advanced: Booby Traps","description":"Carpenter Bee Booby Trap","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"home-and-gardening/carpenter-bees/treatment":{"id":"home-and-gardening/carpenter-bees/treatment","title":"Treating for Carpenter Bees","description":"Sources//entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef611","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"What you\'ll need..","description":"- IDE with .NET 6 SDK","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
